# This is a list of file patterns to ignore when using version control systems
# such as Git or Mercurial.
#
# The file patterns are organized into several categories, including:
#
# - Byte-compiled / optimized / DLL files
# - C extensions
# - Distribution / packaging
# - PyInstaller
# - Installer logs
# - Unit test / coverage reports
# - Translations
# - Django stuff
# - Flask stuff
# - Scrapy stuff
# - Sphinx documentation
# - PyBuilder
# - Jupyter Notebook
# - IPython
# - pyenv
# - pipenv
# - celery beat schedule file
# - SageMath parsed files
# - Environments
# - MacOS
# - Spyder project settings
# - Rope project settings
# - mkdocs documentation
# - mypy
# - Pyre type checker
# - Editors
# - Dask
# - nohup
#
# Each file pattern is a glob pattern that matches a specific set of files.
# For example, the pattern '*.py[cod]' matches any Python file with a .pyc or .pyo
# extension, which are byte-compiled versions of the original source code.
#
# By excluding these files from version control, you can reduce the size of
# your repository, avoid conflicts caused by automatically generated files,
# and improve the performance of version control operations.
